To test, use Eclipse's Run with Coverage and use the TestInput.txt file as input. For a quick test,
the basic test will complete in less than 5 seconds but will not test audio or time delays. For a
more thorough test, use the full test.
 
The test passes if no warnings and exceptions are given by the compiler or during runtime, and exits
normally with an exit code of 0.
